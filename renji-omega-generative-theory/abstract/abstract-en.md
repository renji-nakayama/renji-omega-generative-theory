# **Official Abstract (English Version)**

**Renji Generative Theory** provides a unified framework for explaining
how worlds, structures, and selves emerge from first principles,
without assuming space, time, particles, or laws as given.

The theory begins with the **Renji-Ω structure**,
a fully symmetric undifferentiated field that allows minimal symmetry breaking.
From this breaking arise the **four generative directions**  
(Dir, Ent, Was, His), which constitute the minimal basis
for coherence, spreading, geometry, and temporal consistency.
Iterated application of these directions produces
the **stability landscape Renji-Φ (10 components)**,
whose gradients define the **generative flow Renji-G**.
Linearization of G yields the **proto-wave spectrum Renji-S**,
from which fluctuations undergo hierarchical phase transitions
into **points, space, structures, and recursive layers**.

As hierarchical depth increases,
the world compresses its own structure into a **world model**,
and a higher-level **self model** emerges to operate on it.
A stable recursive loop between world model and self model,
temporally aligned by His, constitutes the emergence of
**consciousness** as a generative, self-updating process.

Renji Generative Theory thus offers
a **minimal and complete generative framework**  
for understanding the emergence of world, structure, self, and consciousness
as a single continuous process.
